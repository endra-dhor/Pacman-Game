![Pacman Screenshot](screenshot.png) <!-- Add a screenshot of your game here -->

## Overview
This project is a recreation of the classic **Pacman game** using **C++** and the **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. It includes core features such as player movement, collision detection, collectible dots, ghost AI, a score system, and game over logic.

## Features
- **Player Movement**: Control Pacman using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents Pacman from moving through walls.
- **Collectible Dots**: Pacman collects dots to increase the score.
- **Ghost AI**: Ghosts move randomly around the map.
- **Score System**: Tracks and displays the score in real-time.
- **Game Over Logic**: Ends the game when Pacman collides with a ghost.

## Prerequisites
Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed:
- **C++ Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or equivalent.
- **SFML Library**: Download and install SFML from [https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
- **Code::Blocks** (optional): If you prefer using an IDE, download Code::Blocks from [http://www.codeblocks.org/](http://www.codeblocks.org/).
